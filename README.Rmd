`P3STAT294` extracts the latest version of vcf_GRCh37 published by  
ClinVar https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/ to create a database that the user can manipulate.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anagonzalezalvarez/P3STAT294", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to download the ClinVar database:
