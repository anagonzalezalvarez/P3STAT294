)
```

```{r setup}
library(P3STAT294)
```

This is a quick introduction of how to use the `P3STAT294` package. 

## `download_clinvar()` function

In `P3STAT294`, the main function we will use is named `download_clinvar()`, it has no arguments, and downloads in the working directory the latest version of Clinvar's vcf_GRCh37 into a file 
clinvar_<date>.vcf. This file is then turned into a database that the function uses
to plot a barplot of all the mutations reported in each chromosome 

### Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(P3STAT294)

mutations_summary <- download_clinvar()
## Will obtain barplot with count of mutation in each chromosome obtained from the latest version of Clinvar's vcf_GRCh37
```
